# STM32 

## NUCLEO-F446R3

This repository contains code for the STM32 NUCLEO-F446R3 board, which is based on the STM32F446RE microcontroller. The code is written in C and uses the STM32 HAL library for hardware abstraction. The main purpose is too document my progress on learning the STM32 platform and to provide a reference for future projects.

## [Documentation](#documentation)
The documentation for this project is available in the `Documentation` directory. It includes information on regards to the board and its features.
