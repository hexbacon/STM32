## NUCLEO-F446RE

This repository contains code for the STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE board, which is based on the STM32F446RE microcontroller. The code is written in C and uses the STM32 HAL library for hardware abstraction. The main purpose is too document my progress on learning the STM32 platform and to provide a reference for future projects.

## What is the NUCLEO-F446RE?
The NUCLEO-F446RE is a development board from STMicroelectronics that features the STM32F446RE microcontroller. It is part of the Nucleo family of boards, which are designed to provide an easy way to develop applications using STM32 microcontrollers. The board includes various peripherals such as LEDs, buttons, and connectors for expansion.
